# PYTHON
YouTube: [lecture 6](https://www.youtube.com/live/5Jppcxc1Qzc?si=teA9VyLbCcCpyzwi)

documentation:
[docs.python.org](docs.python.org)

It doesn't need a compiler but an interpreter that installs locally

To run a python file we have to type in the terminal:

python file.py
```python
print("hello, world")
```
- desn't need semicolon
- Dynamically Typed: we don't need to specify the type of variables
## Comments
```python
# single line comment
'''
block
comment
'''
"""
block
comment
"""
```
## DATA TYPES

C language:
- bool
- char
- double
- loat
- int
- long
- string

Python:
- bool
- float
- int
- str

the reason there is fewer data types is that
we don't have to make a distiction of large
or small data types, because int and float
already give a wide range for larger numbers

Other features:

- range
- list
- tuple x,y pairs for coordinates for example
- dict: key-value pairs
- set: list that get rid of duplicates

## CONDITIONALS

```python
if x > y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
```
## VARIABLES

declaration doesn't need to specify the type (int, char, etc)
just the name and the value.

```python
variableName = 0
```
### INCREMENTS
```python
counter = counter + 1
counter += 1
```
python won't accept: counter++

## print() function
print() can be used to see in the Terminal, the value of va variable or a message to debug the program.
```python
print() # prints just an empty line
print("hello " + "world") # concatenation
print("hello", "world")
print(f"hello {variable}") # format print and interpolating variables
```
print always inserts a line break at the end. To override the line break or print something else at the end of the line:
```python
print("hello", end = "")
print("world", end = "!")
# hello world!
```

## LOOPS

```python
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("meow")
    i += 1
```
```python
for i in [0,1,2]:
    print(f'{i} hello')

for i in range(0,3):
    print(f'{i} hello')

for i in range(3):
    print(f'{i} hello')


'''
0 hello
1 hello
2 hello
'''

```
### Infinite Loop instead of do-while loop
In python there are no do-while loops, the equivalent would be:
```python
while True:
    n = int(input("x: "))
    if n > 0:
        break
    print('enter x again')
```
this code keeps asking for "x" until we enter a positive number.
## INPUT from the user

By default the input() function stores a string
```python
name = input('What\'s your name?')
```
if we want to store a number, we have to use the int() function
```python
age = int(input('How old are you?'))
```

## Floating point formatting

```python
z = 1 / 3

print(z)
# 0.3333333333333333

print(f'{z:.5f}')
# 0.33333
```
### Floating-point imprecition
```python
z = 1/3
print(f'{z:.22f}')
# 0.3333333333333333148296
```

## Integer overflow
In C language:
An integer of 32bit can count as high as 4 billion (just positive or just negative) or from -2 billion to 2 billion. Anything beyond that will not be a correct result.

In python we don't have that problem. As the integer grows, it will take as much bytes as necessary

## Logical operators

```python
x and y
x  or y
  not x
  not y
```

## Object-oriented programminng
An object is a data structure called "class" in python that besides having just data,in this case key-value pairs of properties, they can implement functions built-in, called "methods"

strings for example have methods built-in.

To use a method we use a dot to access the method
```python
'STRING'.lower()
```

## Functions
function declaration:
```python
def functionName():
    # your code here


functionName() # calling a function
```

functions in general have to be declared before they are invokued or called.

## main() function
To reverse the order of declaration of functions to be after the main code, we use the main() function first and call it at the very bottom of the program.

```python
def main():
    for i in range(3):
        meow()

def meow():
    print("meow")

def function2():
    # ...
def function3():
    # ...

main() # calling main()

```
## Scope
variables in python can be accesed ouside of the scope where they were created
```python
def function():
    while True:
        n = int(input("x: "))
        if n > 0:
            break
    return n
    # "n" here exists even if it was created inside the while loop. In C that wouldn't be possible

```

## Types or errors:
- Syntax errors: stop the execution of the program.

- Exception errors: internal event that changes the normal flow of the program.
    - IOError: a file can't open
    - ValueError: built-in function that receives a wrong argument
    - KeyboardInterrupt: when an unrequired key is pressed.

## Try Except
Try and Except statement is used to handle Exception errors.
```python
try:
    # some code
except:
    # executed if error in the try block
else:
    # execute if no exception
finally:
    # some code ... (always executed)
```
```python
try:
    n = int(input("height: "))
except ValueError:
    print("not an integer")
else:
    print("that was an integer")
finally:
    print("test finalized")
```

## LISTS
Create an empty list
```python
emptyList1 = list()
emptyList2 = []
```
### Search in a list

Having a list of names:
```python
names = ["Bill", "Charlie", "Fred"]
name = input("Name: ")
```
Searching long version:
```python
for n in names:
    if name == n:
        print("Found")
    else:
        print("not found")

```
Searching the pythonic version:
```python
if name in names:
    print("found")
else:
    print("not found")
```

## Dictoinaries
Create an empty Dictionary
```python
people = dict()
people = {}
```
A dictionary is a data structure formed by Key:value pairs of data that we want to be related to each other.
```python
people = {
    "Carter": "+1-654-342-2222",
    "David": "+1-454-435-1000"
}
```
### Search in a dict
```python
name = input("Name: ") # David
if name in people:
    print(f"Number: {people[name]}") # +1-454-435-1000
```
```people[name]``` is a similar way to index as an array but instead of numbers (```people[0]```), we can use strings as indexes.

## Swapping two variables
```python
x = 1
y = 2

print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}") # x is 1, y is 2

x, y = y, x

print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}") # x is 2, y is 1
```

## Comparing strings

```python
s = input("s: ")
t = input("t: ")

if s == t: # in C we couldn't just compare two strings directly
    print("same")
else:
    print("different")
```
