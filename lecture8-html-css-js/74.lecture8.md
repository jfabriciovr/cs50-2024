# Lecture 8 HTML, CSS, JavaScript


### Arpanet 1969
First project to interconect a few computers in the US

### Routers
A server that can move data from one point to another

### Protocol
A set of rules outlining how connected devices communicate across a network to exchange data.

### Protocols TCP / IP

IP : Internet Protocol.
Allow computers to know how to address each other on the internet.
IP address form: 4 numbers from 0 to 255, 8bits * 4 = 32bits. so we can have around 4 billion combinations (2^32)

IP v4: 32bit -> 2^32 = 4 billion devices max
000.000.000.000
255.255.255.255

IP v6: 128bit -> 2^128 = 3.4 x10^38. 1028 times larger than v4

TCP: Transmiission Control Protocol. Resolves two main problems:
-  Distinguish one type of service from another. The first one was the web and assigned them a number called a "port"

 80 - HTTP (unsecure or uncrypted)

443 - HTTPS (secure or encrypted)

- Divide the data into packets so when one of them is not recieved (droped packet) it can be solicited again.

So in combination, TCP and IP resolve how to send the data and where to send it through a network.

### DNS
Domain Name System
Is a server that converts names to IP addresses and viceversa.

Local routers function like a cache for dns names for the most visited sites

the way to store the data is like a hash table of keys and values

DOMAIN | IP ADDRESS
- - - - - - - - - -

### HTTP / HTTPS
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (application level)

https://www.example.com.mx/folder/file.html (domain name)

the slash/ represents a path of folders
fiile.html -> is the document with the html code to display the web page.
example.com -> domain name
.com -> Top-level domain (TLD) dominio de nivel superior
.mx -> Country code top-level domain (ccTLD) dominio de nivel superior geogrÃ¡fico
www -> hostname
https -> scheme or protocol to use with that address

### local host
127.0.0.1

### GET / POST
When requesting a web page, HTTP contains detailed information about the address.

GET- download
POST - upload

### Incognito mode
often use by devs to test web pages because doesn't store cookies and begin everytime with a clean slate

### Dev tools
Network -> this section is where we can see that detailed information about what is getting from or sending to the server
(activate "preserve log" to see everything)
 - Headers -> Request Headers:
 ```
 Request Headers

 :authority: www.harvard.edu
 :method: GET
 :path: /
 :scheme: https
```
```
General
HTTP/1.1
Status Code: 200 OK

Response Headers
Content-type: text/html
```
### curl (connect URL)
Shows the headers from a webpage via terminal. Pretends to be a browser.
The data is in key-value pairs

```
curl -I https://www.harvard.edu/

HTTP/2 200
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
link: <https://www.harvard.edu/>; rel=shortlink
```

```
curl -I http://www.harvard.edu/

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://www.harvard.edu/
```

In this case, when using the "insecure" version of the webpage, the response has a code 301 and redirects to the secure version in the key "location".

if we omit the "www" something similar happens:

```
curl -I https://harvard.edu/

HTTP/2 301
server: Varnish
retry-after: 0
location: https://www.harvard.edu/

```

In general this are the more common response codes:

```
200 OK
301 Moved Permanently
302 Found
307 Temporary Redirect
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
418 I'm a Teapot
500 Internal Server Error
503 Service Unavailable

```

### Passing user input to the server

```
GET /search?q=cats HTTP/1.1
Hots: www.google.com
```
Where:
? -> means pasing input to the server
q -> query
cats -> this is the input
host -> pass it to google.com

The result would be a search query to google

If we type this text directly into the URL on a browser:
```
google.com/search?q=cats
```
we will see google search results for "cats"..
