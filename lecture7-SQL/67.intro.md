# SQL Structured Query Language

Language for querying databases.

Is a Relational Databse that stores data in rows and columns that we call TABLES, similar to a spread sheet.

another way to store data is in a `flat-file database` that could be a txt or a `csv` file that separates data with commas for columns and new lines for rows.

Other examples of sotfware to query databases:

- MySQL
- PostgresSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- MariaDB

SQL does four basic things with data: CRUD

- CREATE, INSERT
- Read (SELECT)
- UPDATE
- DELETE, DROP

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table(column type, ...);
```

## Running SQLite

To create a new Database file we will use the command `sqlite3` in the terminal inside VSCode

```
$ sqlite3 favorites.db

Enter ".help" for usage hints.

sqlite>

```

```SQL
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .import favorites.csv favorites
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "favorites"("Timestamp" TEXT, "language" TEXT, "problem" TEXT);
sqlite>
```

### Selecting Data

General form to print columns from a database:

```SQL
SELECT columns FROM table;
```

Selecting and printing the entire table:

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT * FROM favorites;
```

Selecting only the data of the column `languages` from the table "favorites":

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT languages FROM favorites;
```

The same but see only the first 10 elements

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT languages FROM favorites LIMIT 10
```

Some common `keywords`used in SQL are:

- AVG
- COUNT
- DISTINCT
- LOWER
- MAX
- MIN
- UPPER

Counting how many rows or elements are from the table favorites:

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites;
+---------+
| COUNT(*)|
+---------+
| 430     |
+---------+
```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(language) FROM favorite;

+----------------+
| COUNT(language)|
+----------------+
| 230            |
+----------------+

```

`DISTINCT` will show the elements from that column `without duplicates`:

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT(language) FROM favorites;
+----------+
| language |
+----------+
| C        |
| Python   |
| Scratch  |
+----------+
```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(language)) FROM favorites;
+----------------------------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT(languages)) |
+----------------------------+
|  3                         |
+----------------------------+
```

to create an Alias for a column:

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(language)) AS n FROM favorites;
+---+
| n |
+---+
| 3 |
+---+
```

Other keywords that gives us more control are:

- WHERE
- LIKE
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT
- GROUP BY

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites WHERE language = 'C';
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
| 98       |
+----------+
```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites WHERE language = 'C' AND problem = 'Mario';
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
| 3        |
+----------+
```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT language, COUNT(*) FROM favorites GROUP BY language;
+----------+----------+
| language | COUNT(*) |
+----------+----------+
| C        | 98       |
| Python   | 270      |
| Scratch  | 62       |
+----------+----------+
```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT language, COUNT(*) FROM favorites GROUP BY language ORDER BY COUNT(*);
+----------+----------+
| language | COUNT(*) |
+----------+----------+
| Scratch  | 62       |
| C        | 98       |
| Python   | 270      |
+----------+----------+
```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT language, COUNT(*) FROM favorites GROUP BY language ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
+----------+----------+
| language | COUNT(*) |
+----------+----------+
| Python   | 270      |
| C        | 98       |
| Scratch  | 62       |
+----------+----------+
```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT language, COUNT(*) FROM favorites GROUP BY language ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
+----------+----------+
| language | COUNT(*) |
+----------+----------+
| Python   | 270      |
+----------+----------+
```

to show the most popular language using an `alias`

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT language, COUNT(*) AS n FROM favorites GROUP BY language ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 1;

+----------+----------+
| language | n        |
+----------+----------+
| Python   | 270      |
+----------+----------+

```

```SQL
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT(language) FROM favorites;
+----------+
| language |
+----------+
| C        |
| Python   |
| Scratch  |
+----------+
sqlite> INSERT INTO favorites (language, problem) VALUES('SQL', 'Fiftyville');

sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT(language) FROM favorites;
+----------+
| language |
+----------+
| C        |
| Python   |
| Scratch  |
| SQL      |
+----------+

```

To change a set of values, like Find and Replace:

```SQL
sqlite> UPDATE favorites SET language = 'C' WHERE language = 'C++'

```

Delete all the rows with all the columns where the problem is 'Tideman'

```SQL
sqlite> DELETE FROM favorites WHERE problem = 'Tideman';

sqlite> DELETE FROM favorites WHERE Timestamp IS NULL;
```

to Delete all the data from the table:

```SQL
sqlite> DELETE FROM favorites;
```

## DATA TYPES (SQLite)

- BLOB (binary large object)
- INTEGER
- NUMERIC (dd / mm / yyyy) or time (hh:mm:ss)
- REAL
- TEXT

constrains:

- NOT NULL: that data is required
- UNIQUE: when we don't want duplicates

relatioship between tables:

- PRIMARY KEY
- FOREIGN KEY: references other tables
